Red Tetris is an engaging school project aimed at recreating the classic Tetris experience in a real-time online multiplayer environment. Utilizing modern technology and advanced development tools, we sought to deliver an immersive and engaging gaming experience.

The project leverages a robust technology stack, utilizing SvelteKit for frontend development to craft responsive and interactive user interfaces. On the backend, Node.js and Express.js manage application logic, while Socket.io facilitates seamless real-time communication among players. The entire stack is implemented in TypeScript, ensuring a comprehensive and type-safe development environment.

Particular attention was paid to server configuration to ensure optimal performance and a seamless gaming experience. Real-time communication management was a crucial aspect of the project, allowing players to participate in synchronized and interactive games.

In addition to gameplay features, the Red Tetris project also includes player and game administration functionalities. This includes username management, creation and management of game rooms, as well as monitoring server performance.

To ensure code quality and robustness, we incorporated unit and end-to-end tests into our development process. This allowed us to quickly detect and correct errors, ensuring a stable and reliable gaming experience for users.

Finally, project deployment was facilitated by the use of Docker for containerizing applications, as well as Nginx for handling web requests. This approach simplified the deployment process and ensured efficient scalability to meet the growing demand from players.
