The Matcha project, currently still in development, is a web-based dating application that provides its REST API. The technology stack used includes TypeScript, Angular 17, Sass, Node.js, Mustache, Nest.js, Sqlite3, Nginx, and Docker. My responsibilities have included integrating the Figma mockup, designing the reactive user interface, creating Angular components, and developing the user journey, as well as redirecting HTTP requests to the backend.

In this context, one of the unique aspects of the Matcha project is its requirement for user geolocation. This feature, integrated into the application architecture, adds an additional layer of complexity to the development process. Collaborating closely with the backend team, I contributed to the design and implementation of this feature, ensuring its accuracy.

The Matcha project also stands out for its user-centered approach. We have developed a smooth and intuitive user journey, providing a seamless and enjoyable browsing experience. Reactive UI design and Angular component creation were carried out following best practices in web integration.

Another crucial aspect of Matcha development was the efficient handling of HTTP requests to the backend. As a team member, I participated in setting up this transparent communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring the speed and reliability of user interactions.

In summary, the Matcha project is a collaborative work aimed at creating a user-friendly and functional online dating platform. By integrating modern technologies, we aim to provide an exceptional user experience while meeting the technical requirements and challenges of contemporary web development.
