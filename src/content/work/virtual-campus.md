Virtual Campus 42 Nice represents an innovative and collaborative response to the challenges faced by the student community at École 42 Nice. Designed by students, for students, this platform offers a complete Docker environment, integrating all the dependencies and tools necessary for the creation and submission of 42 educational projects. The Virtual Campus stands out for its concern to ensure compatibility across different operating systems, thus ensuring a homogeneous and seamless experience for all users, regardless of their working environment.

This Docker container offers exceptional flexibility by providing a Ubuntu environment containing the tools used at École 42 Nice, whether for projects in C, C++, OpenGL, Node.js, or even for browsers like Firefox. Thanks to the integration of an X server, it also allows the opening of GUI windows for a smooth and transparent user experience.

The Docker architecture of this project may seem intriguing, as it diverges from conventional development practices. This design decision stems from an important consideration: to avoid inadvertently giving an advantage to 42 comrades by providing a ready-made solution for the common trunk project Inception, which involves orchestrating Docker containers.

This platform offers two distinct modes of operation, tailored to the varied needs of students. In defense mode, it allows for collaborative evaluation of projects submitted by comrades, thus fostering knowledge exchange and continuous skill improvement. In development mode, the Virtual Campus binds to the user's working directory, providing a space for real-time coding and compilation while ensuring compatibility with Ubuntu 20, in line with the requirements of École 42.

With Virtual Campus 42 Nice, students benefit from a coherent and homogeneous development environment, regardless of their personal operating system. This solution significantly simplifies the process of project creation and submission, while promoting collaboration among students and offering a rewarding and harmonious learning experience.

The creation of Virtual Campus 42 Nice is directly linked to the administrative closure that École 42 Nice tragically experienced, depriving us of physical premises. Transitioning to virtual learning mode, the need for an integrated digital environment became essential. This project was designed to support less advanced comrades in their curriculum and to help them stay engaged in their studies despite the challenges posed by the situation. Thanks to this initiative, students were able to maintain their progress and commitment to their education, thereby strengthening cohesion and solidarity within the École 42 Nice community.

While this approach presented challenges, it also allowed us to critically reflect on the ethical and pedagogical implications of our architectural choices. Ultimately, this experience sensitized us to the importance of making informed and ethical decisions in software development, even if it means deliberately restricting available technical possibilities.
