Hypertube is an ambitious group project focused on creating a web application for torrenting and streaming movies. Designed for a mobile-first experience, this application aims to provide convenient access to a vast library of films. Hypertube is still in developping phase.

As a member of the frontend team, my primary role is to design and develop the application's user interface. We chose TypeScript as the main language to ensure code stability and security, and Angular as the frontend framework for its robustness and feature-rich capabilities.

The mobile-first approach in our design is crucial to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience across all devices. We pay special attention to the ergonomics and user-friendliness of the interface, ensuring that users can easily navigate through the film library and quickly access their favorite content.

In collaboration with the backend team working with NestJS, a modern and scalable Node.js framework, we ensure that the application delivers optimal performance while providing robust and secure features. To ensure a multilingual experience, we integrate internationalization (i18n) management into our application. This allows us to provide a localized user interface tailored to each user's preferred language. Our goal is to make the application accessible to a wide audience, in English, French, or Arabic.

At the heart of the Hypertube application is an integrated video player, offering a smooth and high-quality streaming experience. Additionally, users have the option to download video files for offline viewing, adding a dimension of flexibility to the viewing experience. Finally, our search bar allows users to easily discover movies based on their preferences, displaying results with their movie posters in the user's language, providing a personalized and immersive experience.
