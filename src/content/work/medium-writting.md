My secondary activity involves writing technical developer articles for the Medium blog. I often engage in this endeavor when facing a challenging situation for which the solution may not have been so obvious to achieve, akin to a memoire.

Each article is a journey through a specific technical challenge, providing insights into the problem-solving process and sharing practical solutions. Through these writings, I hope to contribute to the developer community by providing the resources that have enabled me to address encountered issues.

My articles cover a wide range of topics, from debugging techniques and optimization strategies to best practices in software development. By sharing my experiences and lessons learned, I aim to assist my fellow developers and foster a culture of collaboration and continuous learning within the community.

Writing technical articles is also a personal learning experience for me. It encourages me to deepen my understanding of complex concepts, seek innovative solutions, and articulate my thoughts clearly and concisely.

My background as a technical writer on Medium is still relatively new, but it extends beyond knowledge sharing; it is a platform for exploration, growth, and community building.
