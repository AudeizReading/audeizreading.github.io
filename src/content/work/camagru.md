Camagru is an individual web project focused on creating a photo-sharing site, offering features similar to those of Instagram. Users can capture live photos or upload images from their device, then apply a variety of fun and creative filters. In addition to content creation, users have the ability to browse other users' photos, interact by liking and leaving comments, fostering community engagement.

The application, currently in the design phase, will be built with Angular 17 for the frontend and NestJS for the backend, providing a solid foundation for application development. This approach will allow for a clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend, facilitating maintenance and scalability of the application.

Development of the Camagru project emphasizes simplicity and efficiency. The main goal is to provide a user-friendly and functional platform that meets user needs while maintaining high code quality and performance.

An important requirement of the project is user account management, including authentication and authorization. The authentication system will be based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT), providing a secure and efficient method for managing user sessions and protecting sensitive data.

Finally, one of Camagru's key features is the application of filters to photos. Unlike many similar apps where filters are applied client-side, this feature will be implemented server-side. This will enable consistent application of filters to all uploaded photos, ensuring a cohesive and high-quality user experience.
